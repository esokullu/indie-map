Sites or parts of sites that we initially crawled but later excluded.

* [achor.net](http://achor.net/): huge forum site, has mf2 but not really part of indieweb community.

* [adactio.com/extras/talklikeapirate/translate.php](http://adactio.com/extras/talklikeapirate/): accepts any URL as input, injects into every link in output.

* [airbornesurfer.com/gallery/](http://airbornesurfer.com/gallery/): massive set of photo galleries generated by [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org)

* [dubiousdod.org](http://dubiousdod.org/): domain expired.

* [halfanhour.blogspot.com/search](http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/search): search UI with infinite loop.

* [rhiaro.co.uk](http://rhiaro.co.uk/) defaults response content type to RDF (JSON), not HTML, so I sent it the Accept: text/html HTTP header to use content negotiation and get HTML. That header breaks Known, though, so I didn't send it to any other sites.

* [unrelenting.technology/git/](https://unrelenting.technology/git/): web interface to a bunch of git repos, including version history.

* [waterpigs.co.uk/mentions/webmention/?wmtoken=...](https://waterpigs.co.uk/mentions/webmention/): generates a new token each time.
