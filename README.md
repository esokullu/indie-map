I considered ignoring domains in a blacklist that I know aren't Indie Web, e.g. facebook.com and twitter.com. [Bridgy's blacklist](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/master/domain_blacklist.txt) and the Common Crawl's top 500 domains (`s3://commoncrawl/crawl-analysis/CC-MAIN-2017-13/stats/part-00000.gz`) were good sources. However, in the March 2017 crawl, those top 500 domains comprise just ~505M of the >3B total pages (ie 1/6), which isn't substantial enough to justify the risk of missing anything.

Some parts of [cc-mrjob](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-mrjob/) are included in the `commoncrawl/` subdirectory under the [MIT License](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-mrjob/blob/master/LICENSE).
